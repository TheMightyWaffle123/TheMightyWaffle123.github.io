	 Robots have known since Leonardo de Vinci's time. The first robot was made by Leonardo de Vinci. He made a 
         Design of a "mechanical knight."The robot knight could stand, sit, raise its visor and independently maneuver its arms,
         and had an anatomically correct jaw. His notebook of the robot was found in the 1950s. It was found to be fully 
         functional. It was later redesigned to be more modern. It was a knight with German-Italian medieval armor. It was
	 created in 1495.
