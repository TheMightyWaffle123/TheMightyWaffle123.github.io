	<p align="left">
	 There are many reasons why robots would be useful in our society. One could be to reduce human labor and
	reduce cost. Another is the impact robots could have on quality. Some aplications robots could be better than
	is: gluing, spraying(glue or paint), trimming and de-burring, testing and gauging, assembly of appliances, 
	and laboratory routines. If everyone had a car that was droven by a robot, nobody would try to run the red 
	light. Therefore, there would be less car accidents.

	 Some would argue that a human operator would be better than a robot operator on quality or speed, but a 
	robot operator would not neeed a break and do the task consistently. Also, it would not need to be paid.

	" The fact is, that civilization requires slaves. The Greeks were quite right there. Unless there are slaves 
	to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture, and contemplation become almost impossible. Human 
	slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future
	 of the world depends." -- Oscar Wilde

	Robots in the future would do the three Ds, dirty, dangerous, or dull, work. They would do work inaccessible
	to humans, like outer space, deep undersea, mountainous or desert land areas. They could do housework, like 
	ironing, making beds, cleaning the household, gardening, mowing, anything to keep the house tidy. They could 
	even wash your cars.
